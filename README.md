# Lab 5. Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning Models: Neural Network Classifier and Regressor

In this lab, you will explore the fundamental concepts and practical implementation of quantum machine learning models using Qiskit Machine Learning. The lab guides you through:

* Building quantum feature maps and parameterized ansatz circuits to encode classical data into quantum states.
* Constructing quantum neural networks (QNNs) using the `EstimatorQNN` and `SamplerQNN` classes.
* Training quantum classifiers and regressors using classical optimization algorithms like COBYLA and L-BFGS-B.
* Applying the `NeuralNetworkClassifier` and `NeuralNetworkRegressor` wrappers to streamline the training, prediction, and evaluation processes.
* Experimenting with datasets such as the ad hoc classification set and noisy sine wave regression data.
* Visualizing model performance with plots of decision boundaries, regression curves, and training loss progression.
* Understanding hybrid quantum-classical workflows where quantum circuits provide expressive models and classical optimizers update trainable parameters.

Throughout this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in constructing, training, and evaluating quantum machine learning models, bridging theory and application with Qiskit tools.
